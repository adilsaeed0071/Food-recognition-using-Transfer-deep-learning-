# Food-recognition-using-Transfer-deep-learning-
AlexNet Neural Network with the element of Pattern layer and summation layer. The bias weight of the neural network can be considered using the Sensitivity analysis algorithm. Modified transfer learning of Neural Network majorly used for the classification of up to 1000 different classes with the increased accuracy. The proposed design do the classification of food with the increased accuracy range of 86%. The execution speed is less than 3 seconds with the pre step of training data.
